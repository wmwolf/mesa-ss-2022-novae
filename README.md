# 2022 MESA Summer School Lab 2: Recurrent Novae and Steady Burning
Minimum setup to reproduce the lab website for Bill Wolf's 2022 MESA Summer School lab on recurrent novae and steady burning.

The original website is located [here](https://billwolf.space/projects/mesa-ss-2022/), but this repository has everything needed to reproduce that, though it does rely on some remote javascript that is not controlled by other parties.

# How To Run This
While there is no plan to decommission the original home of the tutorial, you can also spin up a web server to recreate it with this project. The easiest way to do it is to download/clone this repository, and then use a tool like [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to locally serve it to a web browser.
